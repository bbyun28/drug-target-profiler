# Drug Target Profiler: a drug-target interaction network visualization


<p style="text-align:justify;"> <b>Drug Target Profiler</b>(DTP) is an interactive web-application for drug-target interaction network visualization, implemented for guiding drug repurposing and drug mode-of-action studies. The user-specified network is constructed based on integrated bioactivity data, namely dose-response measurements (IC50, EC50, XC50, AC50, Kd, Ki, and Potency).  After entering the names of compounds or proteins of interest (both wildtype and mutant targets), DTP generates an interactive network layout with multiple visualization options for the user. A combined network visualization can be made for a maximum of 10 search entries. Users may also upload their own interaction data and make customized visualizations for compounds and targets beyond those that are available in the DTP database. Figure 1 shows the home page of DTP, where a list of compounds and genes names (in comma separated format) are entered in search box to construct compound target network visualization.. The public version of web application (https://dtv.fimm.fi) is developed using Django framework and its implementation is available <a href="https://github.com/zaidalam/drug-target-profiler/archive/master.zip">here</a>.</p>
